    <h2 class="section-header">About me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Ukraine. There I studied at Kharkiv humanitarian-pedagogical academy and graduated with Masters
      Degree in elementary school teaching. Then I worked at school. In 2018 my family and I moved to the USA. My first
      job here was teacher at Bright Horizons. I liked working with kids. In 2020 the pandemic began and I decided to be
      stay
      home mom and took care of my kids and my husband. Right now I feel like I'm ready to learn new information which
      can help me widen horizons in my life. So I decided to enroll in Epicodus. I'm going to be web developer and
      excited about this!
      When we have free time my family and I like traveling, hiking and going to play to the parks.</p>
